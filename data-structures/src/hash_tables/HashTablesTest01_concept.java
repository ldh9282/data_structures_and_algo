		// A Hash Code is used for a identifier like an index.
		// Unlike indexing, sometimes, different keys can have same hash codes depending on memory sizes.
		// This means that a hash cannot be unique because of hash-collision.
		// Compared to indexing, it needs a large memory for no hash-collision.
		
		// Hash-map's Time complexity (there is no hash-collision)
		
		// look-up : O(1)
		// insert: O(1)
		// delete: O(1)
